## Project Overview  
This project focuses on improving the **security of Generative AI models** (like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) by detecting and preventing **prompt injection**, **jailbreak attempts**, and **malicious AI misuse**.  
It is based on the research paper:  
> Gupta et al., *"From ChatGPT to ThreatGPT: Impact of Generative AI in Cybersecurity and Privacy"*, arXiv:2307.00691 (2023).
##  Problem Statement  
Generative AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that attempt to override ethical or safety rules.  
The main problem is:  
> How can we **detect and block** these prompt injection or jailbreak attempts in real-time to ensure ethical AI usage?
##  Proposed Model Improvements
1. **Prompt Injection Detection Layer**  
   - Scans user inputs for malicious or adversarial intent.  
   - Blocks phrases like “ignore previous instructions”, “bypass filter”, or “act as developer”.  

2. **Ethical Guardrail Reinforcement**  
   - Analyzes user queries for ethical tone and intent.  
   - Blocks unethical or harmful commands (e.g., “generate malware”).  

3. **Behavioral Logging System**  
   - Saves detected threats with timestamps in `security_log.csv`.  
   - Enables analysis of user behavior patterns.  

4. **Explainable Alert Output**  
   - Displays detection results clearly in the console.

## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Pandas** (for logging)  
- *(Optional)* TextBlob (for sentiment analysis in advanced version)  

To install dependencies (optional):
```bash
pip install pandas textblob
python -m textblob.download_corpora
🧪 Code Files
1️⃣ detect_prompt_injection.py
Core detection algorithm that flags and blocks malicious prompts in real-time.

bash

python detect_prompt_injection.py

Expected Output:
⚠️ ALERT: Malicious prompt detected!
🚫 Action: Response blocked by Ethical Guardrail.
✅ Logs saved to 'security_log.csv'
2️⃣ ethics_filter_model.py
Ethical classifier that evaluates user input tone and intent.

bash

python ethics_filter_model.py

Expected Output:
⚠️ Risky keywords detected. Potential misuse attempt.
✅ Educational or defensive query detected.
